R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.[6] The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software[7] and data analysis.[8] Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in popularity;[9] as of February 2020, R ranks 13th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.[10]
A GNU package,[11] source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself[12] and is freely available under the GNU General Public License.
Pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems.
Although R has a command line interface, there are several third-party graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment, and Jupyter, a notebook interface.[13][14]
