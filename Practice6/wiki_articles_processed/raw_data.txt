C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne
Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
The language has
expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features
in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
It is almost always implemented as a
compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation,
LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[6]





C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained
software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[7]
C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure
and resource-constrained applications,[7] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-
commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches
or space probes).[8]

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard
version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as
C++17).[9] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998,
which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards.
The current C++17 standard
supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.
Before the initial standardization
in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an
extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided
high-level features for program organization.[10] C++20 is the next planned standard, keeping with the
current trend of a new version every three years.[11]


Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[17][18] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[19]
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License.
Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
The latest versions are Java 13, released in September 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020.
Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.[20] Since Java 9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 13) or an LTS release.
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[29]
Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.
Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles.
Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it.[30][31] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x[32] and later are supported.
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an open source[33] reference implementation.
A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.[6] The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software[7] and data analysis.[8] Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in popularity;[9] as of February 2020, R ranks 13th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.[10]
A GNU package,[11] source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself[12] and is freely available under the GNU General Public License.
Pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems.
Although R has a command line interface, there are several third-party graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment, and Jupyter, a notebook interface.[13][14]
